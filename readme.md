Small customtkinter app for picking RGB values with a preview-frame for education-purpose.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it, not like I reinvented the wheel.


-Enjoy British Racing Green
-Slide the RGB slider
-Copy RGB Values directly to clipboard

                                

 Cheers and have a nice day wherever you read this !
